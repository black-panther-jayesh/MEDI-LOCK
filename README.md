# MEDI-LOCK
he problem statement is that there is currently no platform specifically designed for the medical sector that allows patients to view and store their medical records digitally using a unique ID.The current platforms lack adequate data storage security and access security, making it difficult for patients to carry and handle their medical documents. This leads to inefficiencies in the healthcare system and can compromise the privacy and security of sensitive patient information. Therefore, there is a need for a secure and efficient platform that can address these issues and improve the overall procedure for managing medical records.
